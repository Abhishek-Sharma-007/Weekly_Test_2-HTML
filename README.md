  2. div Tag: It is commonly used to create sections or divisions in a web page and acts as a container for other HTML elements, such as text, images, forms, or other nested elements.
  3. iframe: The <iframe> element stands for "inline frame" and is used to embed another HTML document or web page within the current document.It creates a window or a frame in which the content of the linked web page is displayed. The <iframe> element is commonly used to embed videos, maps, social media content, or external web pages directly into a web page.
  4. Input Tag: The "input" tag is an HTML element used to create various types of form controls, allowing users to input data or make selections on a web page. It is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't have a separate closing tag.
  5. Anchor Tag: This tag add the link to the text which re-directs us to the address of that Link.
